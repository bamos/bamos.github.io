Brandon Amos is a Research Scientist at Meta Superintelligence Labs in NYC.
He holds a PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University where
he was supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
Prior to joining Meta, he also worked at Adobe Research,
Google DeepMind, and Intel Labs, and served as a visiting
lecturer at Cornell Tech.
He has received best reviewer awards at AISTATS, NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR,
and best paper awards at the ICML Theoretical Foundations Workshop
and ACM MMSys.
His research focuses on foundational topics spanning machine learning,
optimization, reinforcement learning, and control, with the goal of
building safe intelligent systems that understand and interact with
our world. Recently he has been focusing on language modeling and
diffusion/flow-based generative modeling. Major themes of his research
involve attacking language models to improve safety and alignment,
improving RL and control systems, applied optimal transport and flows,
amortization and meta-learning between tasks, and integrating
structural information and domain knowledge into AI systems through
differentiable optimization.
